<h1>Rob Everyone Simulator</h1>
<p>Instructions: As people appear, rob them quickly before they disappear by left clicking them. Each time you rob someone, you'll gain in between 1-5 coins. If you rob someone that appears golden, you'll gain in between 5-15 coins. Be careful to not click people who appear red, because they will kill you, reducing your time left by 10 seconds and stealing 3 coins. Be extremely careful to not rob any frogs, because they will end your game immediately and steal all your coins.</p>
